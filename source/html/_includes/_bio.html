<p><span class="short-duration">I believe that we can create positive change through design.</p></span>
<p><span class="long-duration">My dream is to be part of a team that blends the boundaries between art, design and technology to solve problems that have impact on the quality of our lives.</span></p>

<h5 class="long-duration-block">Professional</h5>
<p><span class="medium-duration">I am</span> <span class="long-duration">currently</span> <span class="medium-duration">Creative Director of Digital Experience at Cinco Design</span> <span class="long-duration">in Portland Oregon. At Cinco, we create the ideas, platforms, products, and experiences that make progressive brands thrive.</span> <span class="medium-duration">We’re a team of design thinkers, from strategists to developers, focused on fostering conversations between brands and their audiences.</span></p>
<p class="long-duration-block">My education and working experience have given me a solid foundation in marketing, technology, and design. I have a BS in economics and experience in e-commerce as well as advertising. I have worked as a tech in a photo studio, a production designer, a UI designer, a UX designer, and a  front-end developer. I have worked with clients including Nike, Microsoft, Nixon, Gogoro, Electronic Arts, Anki, Nextbit  Boa, Bonds, AMP and more.</p>
<p><span class="long-duration">I rely on a constantly evolving user-centered design process that champions user needs through prototyping, learning and collaboration. I get excited about focused and smart design solutions and my favorite digital experiences are the ones that contain refinements to the things that most people don't notice at first glance.</span> <span class="medium-duration">I think good UX conveys emotion and helps define relationships between brands and users.</span></p>

<h5 class="long-duration-block">Personal</h5>
<p class="long-duration">I was born and raised in Laguna Beach California. I grew up immersed in the arts, sports (mostly soccer) and surf culture. Today I live and work in Portland Oregon with my wife Lauren, my son Everett and my Newfoundland dog Maggie Mae. When not at work, I spend most my time chasing my son around the living room or a ball around the soccer field. I also work on several personal projects including The World’s Game, an ongoing photography collection of soccer pitches around the globe.</p>
